#About Holocron Resume

This website was created by me, Levi Ortega, for a Hackathon hosted by the company Spore in which the project took 1st place. The idea behind this project was to create a fun and interactive experience when it came to reviewing resumes. I wanted to incorporate my love for Star Wars and challenge myself by taking on new technologies and competing in my first Hackathon. This project was created using React as the front end, and Firebase/Firestore for the back end, hosting, and database.

#What are Holocrons?

Holocrons are ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom in the Star Wars universe that can only be accessed by those skilled in the Force. I had noticed the similarities between these repositories and what we use Resumes for. Thus, Holocron Resume was born.
