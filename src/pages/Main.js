                <p>This project was created for the Sporediggers hackathon competition. As we all know, resumes are boring, boring to read, boring to write. Well no more, if you're a Star Wars nerd that is. The main goal of this project was to create a fun, interactive, and overall creative experience for those who want to add some flair to their resume. I did this by creating a website where users could create their Star Wars avatar, choose their side, upload their resume, and watch their 'Holocron Resume' come to life.</p>
